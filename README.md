This event is coordinated through Github. [Pull requests][pu]  are welcomed to help making it a better hackathon event.

GOAL
----

 *  Provide a platform for general information exchange with displaced populations

 

 *  Offer means of contribution to refugees (self-initiated surveys and assessments, incident reporting, complaint mechanism)

 

 *  Make UNHCR more approachable (through easy to use appointment booking)

 

 *  Boost some of the slower processes by creating self-service mechanisms (updating contact information, document submission, etc.)
